You can only go back south, although you see a passage north of the zoo.
>zap true
!by one point
You have nothing that the wand would help you cast.
>think
You think of what you've done and what you want to do.

You walk north to the pricky tile, where the mime jumps around in pain. Those spiky bumps hurt!
The mime slumps over. They've taken too much! As they fall over, a mauled scrap flies up from their hands. You take it. They express astonishment and run off, fake-crying. But you swear they winked at you as they looked back.
