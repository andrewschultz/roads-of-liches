A trap zoo holds animals against their will here, making an east-to-west barrier. It's even opaque, so you can't see the animals trapped.
You can only go back south, although you see a passage north of the zoo.

You think of what you've done and what you want to do.

The mime slumps over. They've taken too much! As they fall over, a mauled scrap flies up from their hands. You take it. They express astonishment and run off, fake-crying. But you swear they winked at you as they looked back.
