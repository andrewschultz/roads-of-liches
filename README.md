## Roads of Liches: 2023 EctoComp Grand Guignol entry.

This is a relatively simple stripped-down parser game, part of my *I Heart High Art* series. The first was *Trail Stash*, written in Twine. You can find it below.

It was originally conceived for 2018 and called Welp Haunted.

I only have two more planned at most.
Welp Haunted is planned as the fourth game in my Snooperism series. The first are Very Vile Fairy File (not really spoonerisms) and Tragic Mix and Chic Wit.

There shouldn't be any particularly tricky parts to this repository. It's also unclear whether this will be Petite Mort or Grand Guignol.
