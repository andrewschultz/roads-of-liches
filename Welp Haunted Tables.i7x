Version 1/221116 of Welp Haunted Tables by Andrew Schultz begins here.

"This lays out the major tables for Welp Haunted for easy indexing and searching."

volume stuff that may go to core

definition: a thing (called th) is fungible:
	if th is in location of player, yes;
	no;

verb-dont-print is a truth state that varies.

the spoonerism rules are a rulebook. the spoonerism rules have outcomes unavailable, not-yet, already-done, jump-reject, semi-pass and ready.

already-spoonerized is a truth state that varies.

volume saying stuff

to vcal (t - text): [verb conditional print, flag already rhymed e.g. if HEAP HEAT and then try it again]
	now already-spoonerized is true;
	if verb-dont-print is false, say "[t][line break]";

to vcp (txt - text):
	if verb-dont-print is false, say "[txt]";

a spoonerism rule (this is the pre-start-hopping rule):
	if sco-start-hopping is true:
		vcal "You're already moving. You don't want to get too agitated.";
		already-done;
	ready;

this is the post-start-hopping rule:
	say "It's good to feel you can move. You feel less helpless now.";
	now sco-start-hopping is true;

this is the pre-howl-farm rule:
	if sco-howl-farm is true:
		vcal "You already opened passage to the howl farm.";
		already-done;
	ready;

this is the post-howl-farm rule:
	say "You feel a howl farm off to the side, which is creepy, but it's not physically dangerous.";
	now howl farm is mapped west of ditch park;
	now ditch park is mapped east of howl farm;
	now sco-howl-farm is true;

a spoonerism rule (this is the pre-keep-dry rule):
	if deep cry is not fungible, unavailable;
	if sco-keep-dry is true:

	ready;

this is the post-keep-dry rule:
	say "You keep dry.";

a spoonerism rule (this is the pre-creep-die rule):
	if deep cry is not fungible, unavailable;
	if sco-keep-dry is false:
		vcal "You don't feel the confidence to say that. You need a middle or medium step before that.";
		already-done;
	ready;

this is the post-creep-die rule:
	now sco-creep-die is true;

volume big picture stuff

the check passthroughs rule is listed first in the for printing a parser error rulebook.

rule for printing a parser error (this is the check passthroughs rule):
	let partial-row be 0;
	let row-count be 0;
	repeat through table of passthrough 1:
		increment row-count;
		now verb-dont-print is true;
		process the check-rule entry;
		let rb-out be outcome of the rulebook;
		now verb-dont-print is false;
		if rb-out is unavailable outcome, next;
		let w1 be whether or not the player's command includes word1 entry;
		let w2 be whether or not the player's command includes word2 entry;
		let b1 be boolval of w1;
		let b2 be boolval of w2;
		if b1 + b2 is 0, next;
		if b1 + b2 is 1:
			now partial-row is row-count;
			continue the action;
		process the check-rule entry;
		let rb-out be the outcome of the rulebook;
		if rb-out is the already-done outcome, the rule succeeds;
		if rb-out is the not-yet outcome:
			let exact-cmd be true;
			[let exact-cmd be whether or not the player's command matches the text "[first-of-ors of w1 entry][if there is a w2 entry] [first-of-ors of w2 entry][end if]", case insensitively;]
			if think-cue entry is false:
				say "[line break][one of][b]NOTE[r]: this command[if exact-cmd is false] (well, an equivalent, as there were alternate solutions)[end if] will be useful later, but you aren't ready to use it, yet. You can track commands like this by typing [b]THINK[r], which will also clue you if they now work.[or](useful command[if exact-cmd is false] (or a functionally equivalent alternate solution)[end if] again saved to [b]THINK[r] for later reference.)[stopping]";
				now think-cue entry is true;
			else:
				say "[line break]Hmph. That [if exact-cmd is false](or a functionally equivalent alternate solution) [end if]still doesn't quite work! You'll figure out the how and when and where, though.";
			the rule succeeds;

		process the run-rule entry;
		increment the score;
